            <h3>Hello!</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my website. I'm Abhijit Annaldas from India. I'm a Software Engineer by profession since 2012. I'm a wildly ambitous dreamer, learner and doer at heart. Always trying to learn and do things better and be a better person each day. I strongly believe every person has potential to change the world. I'm trying do my bit.</p>
            </p>My interests and priorities have changed over years as I got clarity about my life goals, calling and better understanding about how I can pursue them. I've been writing since 2010, albeit little sporadically. This domain has undergone multiple avatars as I pointed this to different avatars of my blogs over years as my writing and priorities changed. This is now my main home page, a single point entry to what I am up to with my various endeavours.<p>
            </p>Currently I've two blogs that are live. Old blog written mostly on a variety of technical topics: <A href="http://abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com/" title="http://abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com</A>, I'm not writing here anymore. Recent blog dedicated to Machine Learning: <A href="http://abhijitannaldas.com/ml" title="http://abhijitannaldas.com/ml" target="_blank">abhijitannaldas.com/ml</A>, will write here whenever I spend dedicated time on ML.</p>
            <p class="pt-6"><small><i>I've recently redesiged my home page and reorganized blogs. Some work still in progress.</i></small></p>
