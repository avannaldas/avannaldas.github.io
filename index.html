            Welcome to my website. I'm Abhijit Annaldas from India. I'm a Software Engineer by profession since 2012. I'm a wildly ambitous dreamer, learner and doer at heart. Always trying to learn and do things better and be a better person each day. I strongly believe every person has potential to change the world. I'm trying do my bit.

            My interests and priorities have changed over years as I got clarity about my life goals, calling and better understanding about how I can pursue them. I've been writing since 2010, albeit little sporadically. This domain has undergone multiple avatars as I pointed this to different avatars of my blogs over years as my writing and priorities changed. This is now my main home page, a single point entry to what I am up to with my various endeavours.

            Currently I've two blogs that are live. First blog written mostly on technical topics: <A href="http://abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com/" title="http://abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">abhijitannaldas.wordpress.com</A>, won't be writing there anymore. Recent blog dedicated to Machine Learning: <A href="http://abhijitannaldas.com/ml" title="http://abhijitannaldas.com/ml" target="_blank">abhijitannaldas.com/ml</A>, will write here whenever I spend dedicated time on ML.
